# **Description**
The push_swap project of 42 involves sorting several digits or numbers in ascending order with only a few instructions allowed
# **Instructions**

### **The project only allows the following movements :**

- **sa (swap a)** : Exchange the first 2 elements at the top of the stack a.
- **sb (swap b)** : Exchange the first 2 elements at the top of the stack b.
- **ss** : sa and sb at the same time.
- **pa (push a)** : Take the first element at the top of b and put it on a.
- **pb (push b)** : Take the first element at the top of a and put it on b.
- **ra (rotate a)** : Shifts all the elements of the stack a upwards from one position to.
- **rb (rotate b)** : Shifts all the elements of the stack b upwards from one position to.
- **rr** : ra and rb at the same time.
- **rra (reverse rotate a)** : Shift all the elements of the stack a one position downwards.
- **rrb (reverse rotate b)** : Shift all the elements of the stack b one position downwards .
- **rrr** : rra and rrb at the same time.
